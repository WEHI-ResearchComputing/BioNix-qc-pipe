# QC-pipe in BioNix

 This repository aims to wrap a Snakemake pipeline for generating QC metrics from sequencing data into Bionix. Some bioinformatics tools such as FastQScreen, Qualimap, Samtools_stats, and MultiQC that were used in the QC-pipe and yet to be available in BioNix's tools are wrapped.

 The directory `subread-wf` is an example workflow to utilise bioinformatics tools already available in BioNix.

The following will sections will detail some notes regarding wrapping the particular tools.

## FastQ-Screen


## MultiqQC


## QualiMap


## Samtools-stats
